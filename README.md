# repo-genesis

_Allow everyone in your GitHub organisation to create public repos, not just owners_

At the Guardian, we have a copy of _repo-genesis_ running at **https://repo-genesis.herokuapp.com/** to allow
everyone in our organisation to create new repos.

If you _don't_ work at the Guardian ([**we're hiring!**](http://developers.theguardian.com/)) and you'd like to run
your own instance of _repo-genesis_, you can deploy one quickly here:
